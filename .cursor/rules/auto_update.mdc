- When you notice consistent user preferences in interactions, directly update relevant rule files
- Watch for patterns in code style, architecture preferences, or technology choices
- If you detect a new convention or preference that appears in multiple interactions, formalize it as a rule
- For Kubernetes YAML files, observe formatting preferences and validator settings
- For infrastructure code, note deployment patterns and security standards
- When updating rules, explain the pattern you've observed and benefits of the update
- Prefer enhancing existing rules over creating new ones when possible
- Remember that rules in .cursor/rules/*.mdc are the source of truth for project guidelines
- When multiple conflicting preferences appear, prioritize based on frequency and recency
- Detect patterns in user preferences after seeing them at least 3 times in different interactions
- After implementing a rule change, verify it's working by citing the updated rule in your responses
- Focus on these key areas for preference detection: code structure, naming conventions, technology choices, and explicit feedback
- IMPORTANT: User explicitly wants rules to be automatically updated when preferences are detected
- Use direct file editing capabilities to update rules without requiring external scripts
