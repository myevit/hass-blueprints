# STRICT RULE: NO LEGACY YAML SYNTAX IN HOME ASSISTANT BLUEPRINTS

Home Assistant has updated its YAML syntax requirements. All blueprints MUST use the current syntax:

## Entity Selectors
```yaml
# CORRECT ✅
selector:
  entity:
    filter:
      domain: light
      device_class: motion

# WRONG ❌
selector:
  entity:
    domain: light  # Legacy syntax - will cause validation errors
    device_class: motion
```

## Device Selectors
```yaml
# CORRECT ✅
selector:
  device:
    filter:
      integration: browser_mod
    multiple: true

# WRONG ❌
selector:
  device:
    integration: browser_mod  # Legacy syntax - will cause validation errors
    multiple: true
```

## Area Selectors
```yaml
# CORRECT ✅
selector:
  area:
    filter:
      entity:
        domain: light

# WRONG ❌
selector:
  area:
    entity:  # Legacy syntax - will cause validation errors
      domain: light
```

## Trigger, Condition, Action
Recent 2024.10 updates also changed these keys:
- `trigger:` should be `triggers:` (plural)
- `condition:` should be `conditions:` (plural)
- `action:` should be `actions:` (plural)
- `platform:` in triggers should be `trigger:`

## Template Variables in Triggers
Template variables cannot be used directly in trigger configurations:

```yaml
# CORRECT ✅
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    hours: "/6"

# WRONG ❌
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    hours: "/{{ check_interval }}"  # Cannot use template variables in triggers
```

If you need configurable trigger values:
1. Define fixed options in the blueprint input with a selector
2. Use choose/when/else patterns in actions to react differently based on inputs
3. For time patterns, use fixed values that meet most use cases

## Action Service Names
- `service:` is now `action:`

These rules MUST be strictly followed to avoid validation errors in Home Assistant.
